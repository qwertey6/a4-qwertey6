Include a brief summary of your project here.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Shown in the react-app directory, the webapp uses React running on it's own server to 
                          serve pages to the browser instead of the node server.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The Node server uses the module express to route each endpoint according to it's request method 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: The react app uses the module axios to make easy HTTP requests to the server instead of using xhr

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: The React app uses the React-Router module to route pages correctly, allowing the user of
                            the browser's back button and easy navigation throughout the app
- **Design Achievement 2**: The Node server uses a structured file system to organize the endpoints
- **Design Achievement 3**: The Node server has a logging method that logs each endpoint to the console
- **Design Achievement 4**: Added a Favicon to distinguish our app from every other open tab in your browser


OLD ACIEVEMENTWS FROM PROJECT 3
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using SQLite3 on Heroku (do not do this)
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Everything is made with D3, except for (most) of the XMLHttpRequests.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Made swappable controllers for the maze board. Can click Edit/Play to entirely change how the mouse interaction works. 
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Even the Edit controller is attached to multiple events - users can either simply click to edit the board, or click AND drag.
- **Tech Achievement 5**: The play controller is state-aware. This is necessary to disallow the user from "skipping" through parts of the maze. This was accomplished with higher order functions
- **Tech Achievement 6**: Multiple pages for interacting with the same data at different levels. Seeing all mazes vs interacting with a specific one.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Imported an externally made svg graphic
- **Design Achievement 2**: Layout designed for mobile phones
- **Design Achievement 3**: Render the board with softened edges using filters
- **Design Achievement 4**: Multiple ways to interact with the board while editing. Added click and drag for convenience.
