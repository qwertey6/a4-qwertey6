Assignment 3 - Full Stack: Basic Database-enabled Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  

## Jacob Kaplan | MaZe CrAzE (crazy-case optional)
    MAZE CRAZE is an online game where you can play, edit, and delete mazes which other players create!
    I decided to mostly recreate the 6 person group project which was assigned to me for
     software engineering... as a webware project... on my own! I learned that I should not do this.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using SQLite3 on Heroku (do not do this)
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Everything is made with D3, except for (most) of the XMLHttpRequests.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Made swappable controllers for the maze board. Can click Edit/Play to entirely change how the mouse interaction works. 
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Even the Edit controller is attached to multiple events - users can either simply click to edit the board, or click AND drag.
- **Tech Achievement 5**: The play controller is state-aware. This is necessary to disallow the user from "skipping" through parts of the maze. This was accomplished with higher order functions
- **Tech Achievement 6**: Multiple pages for interacting with the same data at different levels. Seeing all mazes vs interacting with a specific one.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Imported an externally made svg graphic
- **Design Achievement 2**: Layout designed for mobile phones
- **Design Achievement 3**: Render the board with softened edges using filters
- **Design Achievement 4**: Multiple ways to interact with the board while editing. Added click and drag for convenience.
